### Main project

The main project is a variation on the 2004 ICFP Programming Contest,
*Ants*. I've set up a
[GitHub repository](http://www.github.com/wouter-swierstra/ants) with
a problem description, source code, and sample files to get you
started.

The project is not due until the last week of class, but I *strongly*
recommend that you start setting up your machine and start reading the
problem description *now*.

### Assignments

I've uploaded a
[collection of small programming assignments](doc/assignments.pdf).

The first chapter contains a lot of small exercises that you should be
able to complete easily enough if you've already completed the course
on Functional Programming.

I'll ask you to submit a series of these small exercises over the
coming weeks to practice with the material that we've seen in class.

Please submit all your solutions to
[Submit](http://www.cs.uu.nl/docs/submit) before the specified
deadline.

#### Assignment 1

Please submit the following exercises before **Monday, Feb 20**.

* 2.1.1 (20%) - Cabal
* 2.2.2 (20%) - Unfold
* 2.2.5 (15%) - Count
* 2.7.1 (20%) - Permutations
* 2.9.1 (25%) - Proofs

Further assignments will be announced in due course.
