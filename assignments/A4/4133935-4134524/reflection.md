Contracts:
  Everything OK
Generics:
  I liked that we also implemented a Show (simpler version than the one given)
  and that Read and Show are eachother's inverses. Also, we used parser combinators.
Partial:
  Everything OK
Trie:
  We noted that the invariant in the assignment is wrong
  Also we added some nice functionality like toList
  Everything OK
UnsafeIO:
  Everything seems OK to us
 
Final score: 10
