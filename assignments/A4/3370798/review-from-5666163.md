## Unsafe IO
nicely done with the nice way. the unsafePerformIO does not work for me, i just
get a list of zeroes back. who knows what kind of havoc that has invoked.

also nice segfault, i didn't find a way to do it

## Tries
Nice, works. Valid function appears to be working as well, i found this one
difficult.

## Partiality
I cannot find anything that doesn't work. looks good too.

## Contracts
functions correct, proofs correct, and a good explaination of why List and (all
Pos (>0)) are different.

No generic read. -25pts.

well done, 75/100 points
