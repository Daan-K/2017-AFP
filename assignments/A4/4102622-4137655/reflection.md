10/10

## Tries
Correct, concise code.
15/15

## Generics
Parser for strings is not implemented, but the example works well.

20/25

## Partially Monad
Correct.
25/25

## Contracts
`safeListIndex` does not check if the length is >= 0.
Otherwise the code is correct and the proof is clearly shown in LaTeX.
