We liked that we proved the applicative laws for Vector

We forgot to include the identity matrix. Whoops!

There is no second part to exercise 7 in the solutions. We made some proof trees and converted them to Agda, which also works.

Our approach to Exercise 9 is the same as the reference solution.

Missed one identity matrix, but we did some extra work so:
9.75 / 10
