# Monads (35%)

All required functions are implemented and working according to the
specifications. A couple of bonus questions are answered, but not all.

Points: 1.0/1.0

# Foldable (30%)

All functions are implemented and work as expected.

Points: 1.0/1.0

# Teletype IO (25%)

All functions are implemented and work as expected. The instances for Applicative
is required by the newer GHC compilers, and could have been implemented nicer
when it is just the 1-on-1 equivalence of the default applicative.

Points: 1.0/1.0

# Stacks (10%)

Concise implementation using continuations. Works as expected and is well
documented overall.

Points: 1.0/1.0

# Final Grade

Unit testing really helps implementation according to the specifications.
Furthermore, it provides an easy entry point for myself and others to see that
it works when reviewing the code. As we do not have to rewrite the specifications
provided in the assignments
