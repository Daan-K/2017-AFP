## Monads (35%)

Generally concise and well abstracted, though a number of operations could have been split into separate functions to enhance readability (like the formatting of a string in `diagnostics`).

### Exercises

#### Exercise 2.3.1

Correct.

#### Exercise 2.3.2

Correct, although the answer could have been more complete by also including some thoughts about maintainability.

#### Exercise 2.3.3

Correct, but we should also have mentioned more about what should have to be changed in the current implementation.

#### Exercise 2.3.4

Correct


### Grade

Overall quite good, bonus exercises could have been a bit more complete (but they are bonus exercises, so not much is subtracted). The grade is 32%.

## Foldable (30%)

### Exercises

#### Exercise 3.3.3
Correct, but a better notation could have been used by including the Data.Monoid library.

#### Exercise 3.3.4
Correct, but not point free.

#### Exercise 3.3.5
Correct, type signatures could have been merged together.

All the exercises are correct, but the style could have been a bit better. Grade: 25%.

## Teletype IO (25%)

The addition of `putEnd` makes the code more readable and less repetitive. At the end of the file, a dash (-) is missing so the code does not compile directly. Usage of functor operators would have improved readability. Otherwise correct.

The grade is 23%.

## Stacks (10%)

Correct, very concise.

The grade is 10%.

## Total grade:

32+25+23+10=90/100.
