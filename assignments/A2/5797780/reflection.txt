2.3:   Clean implementation of the features implemented. Record type for
       diagnostics is type safe but hard to extend to arbitrary annotations.

       Implemented features include proper tests. Annotations, failure, and
       history are not implemented.

       Score: 10/35.

3.3.3: Simple implementation without superfluous usage of mempty.

       Score: 10/10.

3.3.4: Missing. I should have done it as it was trivial. Score: 0/10.

3.3.5: Missing. Score: 0/10.

2.2.8: Works as expected, tests are included.

       Score: 25/25.

2.2.9: Missing. Score: 0/10.

       Total score: 45/100.
