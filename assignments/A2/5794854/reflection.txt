3.3.{3,4,5}: Everything is correct.

2.2.8: Everything is correct.

Points: 25/25

2.2.9: I like the Haskell type-level capabilities to write an Agda style
correct by construction stack machine where all computations are well formed.

2.3: In this exercise I implemented all the subtasks including the bonus
exercises. This exercise allowed me to learn about the reverse state monad
where the state is not carried top-down through the computation but in a
bottom-up manner. With this it was really straightforward to implement
futureDiagnostics. The only drawback that I had was to implement step by step the
MonadStatePlus (State, Error handling, Diagnostics) instead of already do all of
them at once because it was really tedious to change the definitions and bind
in every step. Probably this is the reason we just use Monad transformer stacks
instead of implementing this kind of things by ourselves.
