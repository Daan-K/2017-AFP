## Monads (35%)

The code looks clean in general. The Monad and Functor instances is a bit long/complicated. Using other monads or a monad transformer might be a good idea.

### Features:

- Feature 1: works
- Feature 2: works
- Feature 3: works

### Exercises

#### Exercise 2.3.1

Correct.

#### Exercise 2.3.2

Explained very well. Each feature is considered.

#### Exercise 2.3.3

Correct.

#### Exercise 2.3.4

Fine. However there are cases where the future depends on the output of `diagnosticsFuture` such that this does not work.

### Unit tests

Well integrated with Cabal.

### Grade

Looks good, only two small objections. The grade is 33%.

## Foldable (30%)

### Exercises
Another definition for the rose tree was used than stated in the exercises. It was not very clear which one had to be used however, so no points are deducted.


#### Exercise 3.3.3
Correct, nice infixing of the mappend function.

#### Exercise 3.3.4
Correct, good point free style.

#### Exercise 3.3.5
Correct

The grade is 30%,

## Teletype IO (25%)

The `accum` function does not return if a zero is provided. The `get` function in the MonadState instance could be written without a lambda. Otherwise correct.

The grade is: 22%.

## Stacks (10%)

Generic implementations. The second part already uses kinds and Vec and Nat data types!

The grade is 10%.

## Total grade:

33+30+22+10=95/100.
