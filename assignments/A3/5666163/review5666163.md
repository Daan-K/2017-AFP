## Review of Assignment 3 (\#5666163)

### General notes
The assignment does not compile in GHC 7 or GHC 8. It can be fixed in 7 by providing a type signature for `drawTree` as such: `drawTree :: (Show a) => Tree a -> String`. -5.

### Tail Recursion
Correct, nicely concise.

### Fix
Correct.

### Nested Types
The style is not everywhere as clean as it could have been, but in general it is good enough and also correct.

### Evidence Translation
Type of sizedInt is correct. The evidence translation is also correct.


Score: 95/100
