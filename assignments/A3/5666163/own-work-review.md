## Tail recursive split
it's tail recursive, it works

## Fix
it works, i made it with a case to drive evaluation

## Nested Types
everything correct, i agree that the style is not everywhere as nice as it could
have been but well, it's an exercise.

## Evidence translation
i found this the single hardest exercise there was. I get the idea of how ghc
does this but it will remain a puzzle if i ever have to do this again.

everything works and i don't feel comfortoble giving myself max points, perhaps
for the style. i am in agreement with my reviewer of 95/100
