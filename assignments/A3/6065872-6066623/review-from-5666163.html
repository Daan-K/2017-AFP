<h2>2.2.1 - Tail Recursive Split</h2>

<p>Nice naming, always keep humour there to make difficult things easier to bear.</p>

<p>I see you are building a list of right subtrees and then finding the leftmost
leaf, then moving the right side of the leftmost node one level up and then
going back up to reconstruct the tree. The definition is a bit sloppy and
although the result is correct this is not tail recursive. A function is tail
recursive when the last thing it does is return <em>or</em> call itself. It is nice to
have because it can be compiled to very efficient while-loops.</p>

<h2>2.2.3 - Fix</h2>

<p>the definition is right, but you did not give a type signature on the top level.
It is better to do so. <code>foldr :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; b</code>, or how i read
it is "Stick the default element at the back of the list and shove the function
in between:</p>

<p>consider a list of numbers: <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> and the definition of a sum: <code>foldr
(+) 0</code>, now you can read: "put the 0 at the end and put the + in between:</p>

<p><code>1 2 3 4</code> becomes <code>1 2 3 4 0</code></p>

<p>shove the function in between
<code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 0</code></p>

<p>that really made it easy for me to understand -- at least -- list folds.</p>

<p>another example with strings and concat: <code>concat = foldr (++) ""</code> and <code>strings =
["hello", " ", "world"]</code></p>

<p><code>"hello" " " "world"</code> becomes <code>"hello" " " "world" ""</code></p>

<p>shove the function in between
<code>"hello" ++ " " ++ "world" ++ ""</code></p>

<p>evaluates to
<code>"hello world"</code></p>

<p>Another thing to note is that if you use functions like null, head and tail, you
introduce lazyness in the function (remember that pattern matching drives
evaluation). Another way to write the fold would be</p>

<p><code>
foldr' = fix (\ rec f acc l -&gt;
  case l of { [] -&gt; acc; (x:xs) -&gt; x `f` rec f acc xs) }
</code></p>

<p>this is more strict. It does <em>not</em> however, make your implementation wrong.</p>

<h2>2.4.1 - Y-Combinator</h2>

<p>The definition is right. If there is only one value enclosed in the type, use a
newtype instead</p>

<p><code>haskell
data MyInt = MyInt { unMyInt :: Int }</code></p>

<p>in this case, the memory representation is
  MyInt --> MyInt memory structure --> Integer</p>

<p>if you instead use</p>

<p><code>haskell
newtype MyInt = MyInt { unMyInt :: Int }</code></p>

<p>you omit the intermediate structure:
  MyInt --> Integer</p>

<p>In other words: it directly points to the integer inside, which makes it faster
because of reasons.</p>
