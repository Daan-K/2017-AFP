## Review of Assignment 3

### Tail Recursion

The function is tail recursive, but it returns the wrong result. Below is a counter-example found by QuickCheck:

*** Failed! Falsifiable (after 9 tests and 11 shrinks):
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
(0,Just (Node (Leaf 0) (Node (Node (Leaf 0) (Leaf 0)) (Node (Node (Leaf 0) (Leaf 0)) (Node (Leaf 0) (Leaf 0)))))) /= (0,Just (Node (Node (Leaf 0) (Node (Leaf 0) (Leaf 0))) (Node (Node (Leaf 0) (Leaf 0)) (Node (Leaf 0) (Leaf 0)))))

Note: the right side is produced by the specification (found in the PDF)

### Fix

Correct.

### Nested Types

Correct.

### Evidence Translation

Correct. Using do notation instead of explicit binds with lambdas would have been prettier.
