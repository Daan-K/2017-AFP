Working tail recursive implementation.

Points: 1.0/1.0

# Fix (25%)

Working fixed-point implementation. Accumulating parameter could have been
implemented without a tuple, and therefore without needing the call to `snd`
to get the result.

Points: 1.0/1.0

# Nested Types (25%)

Working implementation. The compile error is expected. All questions answered.

Points: 1.0/1.0

# Evidence Translation (25%)

this hard to check, as I wasn't able to complete the assignment myself.
