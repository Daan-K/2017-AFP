---------

2.1.1 Cabal - 9 * 0.2 = 1.8

I have a Cabal file, and it works. (installs, can then be used). 

2.2.2 Unfold - 7 * 0.2 = 1.4

My solutions for iterate and map are equal to the model solution, so I'm going
to assume them optimal. `balanced` has no error checking to see if the
argument is negative but is otherwise equal. (10, 10, 8)

`sized` is doing something else entirely, creating a tree of N nodes rather 
than a tree of depth N. (This is how I had interpreted "generates any tree
with the given number of nodes", but I'll not give myself points for it.)

(10 + 10 + 8 + 0) / 4 = 7

2.2.5 Count - 9 * 0.15 = 1.35

Both versions are implemented, using only one typeclass that generalizes the
underlying pattern for both. I think I deserve a style point for that.

2.7.1 Permutation - 8 * 0.2 = 1.6

My solution is written in a different way from the solution set, but does
work, and it builds and prunes the tree lazily (i.e. `smooth_perms 1 [1..100]`
runs in about a second on my machine and gives the right answer, so it can't
be doing it strictly).

2.9.1 Proofs - 8 * 0.25 = 2.0

The proofs seem to mostly match up. The `length` one is slightly different.`
