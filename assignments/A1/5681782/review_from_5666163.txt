*** cabal ***
cabal install works, package looks good

*** unfoldr ***
unfold for list uses a case instead of a where clause, this is a matter of taste
and i will not deduct any points for that.

balanced helper function does not have an error case for negative numbers. It is
important to have one because that will trigger an error rather than loop
infinitely.
-5 points

*** count ***

Count is not the same as in the solution but it uses list length instead of an
integer to encode the amount of arguments passed to the count function. I'd say
that the approach is similar but the encoding is equivalent.

*** permutations ***

Two data types for the same tree is a bit odd. The top level could be just a
list.
-2 points

pruning is a bit bulky, the solution uses a list comprehension which is nicer to
read and performs better.
-10 points


Getting the paths uses concat . map (or concatMap) instead of list monad bind
(which is equivalent, but bind is nicer).
-5 points

*** proof ***
proofs are equivalent

100 - 22 = 78 points left over.
