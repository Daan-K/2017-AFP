## 2.1.1 (20%) - Cabal
It is present and it works.

## 2.2.2 (20%) - Unfold
`Iterate` has an unnecessary application of f on y.
 
The implementation of `sized` is different from the reference implementation, but we argue that the reference implementation is wrong. The exercise requires n nodes, but the reference implementation produces 2^n nodes (so the depth, not the amount).

## 2.2.5 (15%) - Count
Effectively the same as the reference implementation.

## 2.7.1 (20%) - Permutations
Our implementation does more work in separate functions, while the reference version computes more in `smoothPerms`. Our version is more generic.
