The final grade is 10.

# Cabal

The project is correctly packaged with cabal. Therefore, we grade this part with a 10.

# Unfold

The implementation is very similar to the reference. Everything is as simple as it can
be written. Therefore, we grade this part with a 10.

# Count

The implementation is similar to the reference. Therefore, we grade this part with a 10.

# Permutations

The implementation is generic for any kind of number and also provides a `perms` function
that works on any type that is an instance of the `Eq` typeclass. The data type used
to represent the tree is different than the one in the reference, but works great anyway.
We grade this with a 10.

# Proofs

Wonderful LaTeX! We grade this with a 10.
