# Cabal (20%)

It exists. It has tests and fields are filled. It uses Stack.

1 / 1.

# Unfold (20%)

`iterate` and `map` defined properly (with tests) in point-free style.

`balanced` and `sized` defined properly (with tests). Signedness of integers
used (abused) to fake `Either Word Word`.

1 / 1.

# Count (15%)

Simple correct implementation. Not the shortest possible though, the `count`
function does not need to be in the class. Solution does not use language
extensions.

1 / 1.

# Permutations (20%)

Correct solution based on list "cursors", with a test that verifies against
naive implementation. Tree modelled with explicit "stop" node to ensure that the
empty list is not a special case.

1 / 1.

# Proof (25%)

Proof is correct.

# Final grade
