2.1.1 Cabal - 10 * 0.2 = 2

There is a cabal file, it installs and works. Style points for having
organized the answers in separate modules.

2.2.2 Unfold - 9 * 0.2 = 1.8

`iterate` is the exact solution given in the solution set. (10)
`map` is also the exact solution given in the solution set. (10)
`balanced` lacks the error checking but otherwise works. (8)
`sized` does the same thing as in the solution set. However, you could
have used the built-in `splitAt` rather than writing your own. (8)

(10 + 10 + 8 + 8) / 4 = 9

2.2.5 Count - 8 * 0.15 = 1.2

Both versions are present and they work. They are defined in a slightly
roundabout way, and one of them was commented out.

2.7.1 Permutation - 8 * 0.2 = 1.6

The solution is written in a different way from the solution set, but it
does work. `smoothPermutations 1 [1..100]` also works, so it is obvious that 
the tree is built lazily.

2.9.1 Proofs - 10 * 0.25 = 2.5

The proofs seem to match up. They have also been nicely typeset.
