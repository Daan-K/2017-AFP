# Cabal (20%)

The Cabal file is present and has all required fields. Would recommend to write
tests in future works. However, this is not required for this assignment.

Points: 1.0/1.0

# Unfold (20%)

Functions `iterate`, `map` implementen correctly.
Function `balanced` is missing the case of negative integers, thus could loop
forever. (-0.1)
Function `sized` implementation could have been simpler, re-implementation of
`split` function is not needed (could have used one from the Prelude/Data.List).
(-0.1)

Points: 0.8/1.0

# Count (15%)

First approximation is equivalent to the given solution.
Complete solution reaches the same effects, but is implemented in a different
manner.

Points: 1.0/1.0

# Permutations (20%)

Permutation tree has a 'root' node defined, which is not needed. (-0.1)
Given solution is a bit more verbose than the reference solution, but is well
documented and has the same effects.

Points: 0.9/1.0

# Proofs (25%)

The lemma is proved correctly.
The theorem is proved correctly.

Points: 1.0/1.0

# Final Grade
